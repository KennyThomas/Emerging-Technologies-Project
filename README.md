# Emerging-Technologies-Project
Predict power generated by wind speed using a model.

## `Deployment`
### Using Docker
* Clone the project
* Open the project in cmd
* Run the command "docker build -t emerging-tech-project ."
* Next run the command "docker run -d -p 5000:5000 emerging-tech-project"
* Open a browser and use the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000"

## `How it works`
In a Jupyter Notebook, I created two models to test which model is the more accurate to use.<br>
* The first model is a Keras Model.
* The second model is a Decision Tree.
### The model
The models work by taking in a csv file that contains wind speeds and wind power.<br> 
The models then use this data to predict the power by taking in a wind speed.<br>
The Keras model was the least accurate when taking in a value like 0, it outputed a power around 3 which should be 0.<br>
The Decision Tree was the most accurate when taking in wind speeds.


### Using Flask with the model
To use the model in Flas, I created a pickle file from the model.<br>
I can then call this model in flask and use the method "predict" to display the power in a html file.
